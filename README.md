Implementing GOF design patterns in C#


### 1. Creational patterns
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

#### Abstract Factory  
Creates an instance of several families of classes

#### Builder  
Separates object construction from its representation

#### Factory Method  
Creates an instance of several derived classes

#### Object Pool  
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use

#### Prototype  
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

#### Singleton  
A class of which only a single instance can exist

### 2. Structural Design Patterns
Structural Design Patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

#### Adapter  
Match interfaces of different classes

#### Bridge  
Separates an object's interface from its implementation

#### Composite  
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

#### Decorator  
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

#### Facade  
A single class that represents an entire subsystem

#### Flyweight  
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

#### Private Class Data  
Restricts accessor/mutator access

#### Proxy  
An object representing another object

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns 
 Behavioral design patternsare are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
 
#### Chain of responsibility  
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

#### Command  
Encapsulate a command request as an object

#### Interpreter  
A way to include language elements in a program

#### Iterator  
Sequentially access the elements of a collection

#### Mediator  
Defines simplified communication between classes

#### Memento  
Capture and restore an object's internal state

#### Null Object  
Designed to act as a default value of an object

#### Observer  
A way of notifying change to a number of classes

#### State  
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

#### Strategy  
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

#### Template method  
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

#### Visitor  
Defines a new operation to a class without change
